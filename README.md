Doing Stuff With Data

2/14/24 pt 1: Completed the basic styling and html for the interface, and got the data to display as well. I have the amount per page functional and the sorting buttons are half-way there, but the page buttons are non-functional. 2/14/24 pt 2: I have the sorting buttons done, the only thing I need to do are the page buttons. My current idea is to split the main array into multiple arrays, based on how many pages there should be. Then, on every page change, change the array that is being shown on the screen.
